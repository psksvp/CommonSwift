/**

moved_to
    A file or directory was moved into a watched directory. This event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the same directory.
moved_from
    A file or directory was moved from a watched directory. This event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to the same directory.
move
    A file or directory was moved from or to a watched directory. Note that this is actually implemented simply by listening for both moved_to and moved_from, hence all close events received will be output as one or both of these, not MOVE.
move_self
    A watched file or directory was moved. After this event, the file or directory is no longer being watched.
create
    A file or directory was created within a watched directory.
delete
    A file or directory within a watched directory was deleted.
delete_self
